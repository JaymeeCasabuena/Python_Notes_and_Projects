Algorithm notes

Two pointer algorithm cares mostly about two individual elements
that the pointers are keeping track


Slinding windows cares about the whole window either unique values or the sum of all values



1. Arrays

Common Patterns

** Sliding Window:
Problems: Maximum subarray sum, longest substring without repeating characters.
When to Use: When dealing with contiguous subarrays or substrings.

** Two Pointers:
Problems: Pair with target sum, sorting and merging two arrays.
When to Use: When working on sorted arrays or finding pairs/triplets.

** Prefix Sum/Accumulation:
Problems: Subarray sum equals k, range sum query.
When to Use: When calculating cumulative results for subarrays.

**  Sorting + Binary Search:
Problems: Find missing number, find element in rotated sorted array.
When to Use: When you need to search efficiently or sort first for easier iteration.


**  Sliding Window:
Problems: Longest substring without repeating characters, anagrams in a string.

**  Two Pointers:
Problems: Valid palindrome, longest palindromic substring.
When to Use: When comparing elements from both ends.

**  Trie:
Problems: Word search, autocomplete systems.
When to Use: When working with prefix-based problems.

**  Hashmap for Character Frequency:
Problems: Anagrams, frequency of characters.
When to Use: When the problem involves character counting or comparison.
